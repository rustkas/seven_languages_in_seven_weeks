# Tic tac toe game

For fun and a better understanding of programming in the language Erlang, I wrote console "Tic-Tac-Toe" game.

I liked Erlang programming. 

Useful commands:
```
typer tic_tac_toe_game.erl
dialyzer --no_check_plt --src -pa ..\tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe_game.erl ..\tic_tac_toe\tic_tac_toe.erl

# to run the game
escript run
```
